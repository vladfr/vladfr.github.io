I've tried now more than once to get started with Bootstrap efficiently. I find it's a nice framework for authoring when you're a hard-core geek, but I lack design practice (I like to think that it's the only thing I'm missing when it comes to visual design - although alas, the voice of reason yells loudly) so I decided to make an exhaustive list of all the little things to turn Bootstrap into a powerhouse.

This will be a work-in-progress, but the goal is to have as few resources as possible at the best quality, i.e. he most complete component (slider, modal) or the two most representative "Flat Design" themes.
