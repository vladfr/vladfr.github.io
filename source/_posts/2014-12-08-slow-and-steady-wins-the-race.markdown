As I grow as a programmer, I realize that what worked until now might not work in the future. 

Learning new languages gets faster with time, but I wonder if it's worth it. New frameworks are great after the first 10 minutes. Then you realize it doesn't solve actual problems - it's just different. Or, if it does away with the clumsy old ways, it brings new challenges into the mix. This dance is becoming tedious.

The ever-faster rhythm of change makes me stick to my guns when coding, but I also go slower about it. As I progress, I tend to stop and think more - hopefully, producing better code.

Here's two interesting reads on the topic via #hackernewsletter: [Java for everything](http://buff.ly/1G4G1UO) and [The Case for Slow Programming](http://buff.ly/1w2ohX7)
Thoughts?
